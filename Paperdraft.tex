\begin{abstract}
This work deals with validating the established approach of analyzing VLBI intensive sessions to determine dUT1. VLBI sessions from the CONT17 campaign are chosen as they provide continuous VLBI observations over two weeks (28th Nov - 12th Dec 2017) of the currently highest quality. For the standard 24-hour sessions in this campaign, two different legacy networks were involved, the legacy-1 network, which was entirely based on IVS network stations with global distribution, and legacy-2 network involving VLBA and a few IVS network stations for the global extension. In addition to these 24-hour sessions, two different IVS and one Russian intensive sessions were observed every day during CONT17. The dUT1 determined from the intensive sessions are compared with daily and hourly dUT1 from 24-hour sessions during this 15-day time-frame. The results show that the dUT1 determined from intensive sessions do not show good agreement with daily dUT1 from 24-hour sessions; however, it shows better agreement with hourly
dUT1.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
The term UT1-UTC represents the corrections to the phase of the Earth rotation angle $\Omega$ UT1 ($\Omega$ is the nominal Earth angular velocity). Very long baseline interferometry is the only space geodetic technique which is can determine UT1-UTC. It is a microwave-based space geodetic technique that measures the difference in signal arrival times from the extragalactic radio source (e.g., the Quasars) receiving simultaneously at two or more radio telescopes. As GNSS satellites require UT1-UTC daily as an important input, this quantity has to be determined fairly on a daily basis. \\
The International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry (IVS) established so-called Intensive sessions, which are being carried out since 1985. The primary objective of intensive sessions is to determine UT1-UTC, and it consists of one VLBI baseline, and it typically spans over for one hour. The baselines consist of a large east-west extension as UT1 is highly sensitive to it. The stations which take part in the intensive sessions are mentioned in the table. The accuracy of UT1 estimates obtained from intensive sessions is about 15 microseconds, whereas the accuracy of UT1 estimates from 24-hour VLBI sessions is about 6-7 microseconds. The parameterization used for the analysis of intensive sessions are different from the parameterization of 24-hour sessions and can be seen in the table. As seen from the table, we do not estimate most of the parameters while analyzing intensive sessions, because the intensive sessions do not contain enough observations per parameter. Besides, the station coordinates cannot be estimated as one baseline is insufficient to fix the degree of freedom of the terrestrial basis. The dUT1, which is estimated from this approach, may contain inaccuracies. As intensive sessions contain observations for one hour, they give rise to correlations between CPO and terrestrial pole coordinates. Whereas analyzing 24-hour VLBI sessions, the parameters which were fixed to their respective apriori values in the approach mentioned above, are estimated in this approach. This is possible as the 24-hour sessions contain multiple baselines and enough observations per parameter. \\
This can be validated by comparing dUT1 values derived from intensive sessions and 24-hour VLBI sessions. Generally, the 24-hour and intensive sessions coincide only 2-3 days a week, but during continuous VLBI campaign CONT-17, the 24-hour and intensive sessions take place on the same day for 15 days. This provides an excellent opportunity to compare dUT1 values from these sessions. During this campaign, two kinds of 24-hour sessions and three types of the intensive session took place. We will discuss it's detailed in the next section.
